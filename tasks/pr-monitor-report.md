## Environment Constraints (ongoing)

- `gh` CLI not installed in this environment (`command not found`).
- GitHub MCP server is configured for `suboss87/openclaw` only; `openclaw/openclaw` PR CI
  check runs and review thread/comment bodies are inaccessible via direct MCP calls.
- `search_pull_requests` provides partial read access to `openclaw/openclaw` (PR state,
  timestamps, comment counts, labels) but not full comment/review bodies.
- **Action required by operator:** Install `gh` CLI (authenticated) or extend MCP scope to
  `openclaw/openclaw` to restore full monitoring capability (including review thread content).

## Monitoring Artifact Contamination (standing note — moot)

Runs 3–9 accidentally committed `tasks/pr-monitor-report.md` updates to branches
`feat/cron-fresh-session-option` and `fix/subagent-identity-fallback`. Both PRs are now
closed, so this is no longer a merge blocker.
