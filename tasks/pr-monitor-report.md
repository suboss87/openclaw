## PR #45911 — fix/telegram-approval-callback-fallback

**Status:** MERGED (merged_at: 2026-03-29T05:15:58Z)

Confirmed merged — absent from `is:open author:suboss87` search. Squash-merge commit
`14fd49c362b7d84b8fda157967befe2a0ca730f5` on the fork branch (message includes `#45911` and
`thanks @suboss87`, authored by maintainer `obviyus`).
Fork's `main` has not been synced with upstream yet.
No action required.

**Branch tip (fork):** `14fd49c362b7d84b8fda157967befe2a0ca730f5` (unchanged since run 16)

## PR #45584 — feat/cron-fresh-session-option

**Status:** OPEN | **Branch:** `feat/cron-fresh-session-option`
**Head SHA:** `46e2b30607303996c6423abd33ec854c42b57ac3` (2026-04-06 — **unchanged since run 9**)
**Last PR activity:** 2026-04-06T03:49:37Z (10 days stale as of this run — **unchanged from run 24**)

**Commits unique to PR branch vs fork/main (in order, oldest first):**

| SHA         | Date       | Subject                                                           | Notes                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `cb7f5c9630` | 2026-03-25 | feat(cron): add freshSession option to control session reuse per job | Legitimate PR commit      |
| `569a0bdfab` | 2026-04-06 | chore(protocol): regenerate Swift models for freshSession cron field | Legitimate (CI fix)       |
| `46e2b30607` | 2026-04-06 | chore(format): fix markdown formatting in pr-monitor-report       | **Monitoring artifact**   |

**Upstream conflict (carried from run 16 — GitHub API confirmed):**
`mergeable: false`, `mergeable_state: dirty` — conflicts with `openclaw/openclaw:main`.
Upstream remote is not reachable from this environment; automated rebase not possible.
`review:changes_requested` search returned 0 results — no formal changes requested.

**CI (carried from run 16):** Only label checks running; build/test CI blocked by dirty state.

**Reviews (carried from run 16):** Two bot reviews, both addressed in code:
- `greptile-apps[bot]`: JSDoc accuracy — already correct on branch.
- `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`: `freshSession` propagation — already implemented in `src/cron/service/jobs.ts`.
No human maintainer reviews. No `CHANGES_REQUESTED` per GitHub search.

**No new activity since run 9 (2026-04-06). Branch tip unchanged since run 26.**

**Needs human attention:**
1. **Upstream rebase required** — dirty against `openclaw/openclaw:main`; cannot be done from this environment.
2. **Remove monitoring artifact** — commit `46e2b30607` (tip) adds `tasks/pr-monitor-report.md` to the PR diff; remove via interactive rebase before merge.
3. **Re-trigger CI** after rebase to confirm all checks pass.

## PR #54363 — fix/chat-send-button-contrast

**Status:** CLOSED (closed_at: 2026-03-27T14:12:49Z, merged: false)

Confirmed closed — absent from `is:open author:suboss87` search. Closed without merge;
maintainer `velvet-shark` noted PR #55075 landed the same fix as part of a broader
design-system cleanup. Branch still exists on fork at tip `76c2ea44d857b9ae68cf056dfc72c8e4d4cfcd64` (unchanged).
No action required.

Head SHA unchanged since run 9; failures assessed as pre-existing on main or flaky shards.
`checks-node-channels` (core channel code) passes — confirms PR's `resolveAssistantIdentity`
changes are not causing node-layer failures.
`review:changes_requested` search returned 0 results — no formal changes requested.

**Reviews (carried from run 16):**
- `greptile-apps[bot]`: Flagged redundant `resolveDefaultAgentId` call — addressed in `8fb20f890e`.
- No human maintainer reviews; no `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.
- Community: `MoltyCel` confirmed fix logic and tests look correct (2026-04-06/07).

**No new activity since run 9 (2026-04-06). Branch tip unchanged since run 26.**

**Needs human attention:**
1. **CI investigation** — confirm whether `security-fast`, `checks-fast-contracts-protocol`, and
   failing extension shards are pre-existing on main or caused by this PR. If pre-existing,
   maintainer can approve/merge regardless.
2. **Remove monitoring artifacts** — commits `d18c8771bb` and `f052129db4` (tips) add
   `tasks/pr-monitor-report.md` to PR diff; remove via interactive rebase before merge.
3. **Maintainer review** — no human review yet despite positive community feedback. Fix addresses
   a real subagent identity regression; candidate for maintainer review pass.

## Actions Taken This Run (run 26 — 2026-04-16)

**GitHub API access:** BLOCKED — MCP restricted to `suboss87/openclaw` (fork only); `gh` CLI not
installed; `openclaw/openclaw` PRs are not accessible via direct MCP calls. `search_pull_requests`
and `search_issues` provide partial read access to `openclaw/openclaw` (PR state, comment counts,
label state, review-state filters) but not full comment/review bodies.

**Branch SHAs confirmed from fork (run 26 vs run 25):**

| Branch                                  | SHA (tip)                                  | Changed since run 25? |

## PRs Requiring Human Attention

| PR | Issue | Priority | Update (run 26) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| openclaw/openclaw#45584 | Re-trigger CI after rebase | Medium | Blocked on rebase |

## Environment Constraints (ongoing)

- `gh` CLI not installed in this environment (`command not found`).
- GitHub MCP server is configured for `suboss87/openclaw` only; `openclaw/openclaw` PRs, CI
  check runs, and review threads are inaccessible via direct MCP calls.
- `search_pull_requests` and `search_issues` provide partial read access to `openclaw/openclaw`
  (PR state, comment counts, label state, review-state filters) but not full comment/review bodies.
- Upstream `openclaw/openclaw` remote not configured; git proxy not reachable for that repo.
- Fork git proxy (`origin`) works for fork branches only.
- **Action required by operator:** Install `gh` CLI (authenticated) or extend MCP scope to
  `openclaw/openclaw` to restore full monitoring capability.

## Note on Monitoring Artifact Contamination (standing note)

Runs 3–9 accidentally committed `tasks/pr-monitor-report.md` updates to the PR branches
`feat/cron-fresh-session-option` and `fix/subagent-identity-fallback`. These commits are now
the tip commits on those branches and will appear in the PR diff on GitHub. They must be removed
via interactive rebase before those PRs can be merged cleanly.

Going forward, monitoring report commits are made only to the fork's `main` branch (or the
detached HEAD session branch), never to contributor PR branches.
